# Literate-Eureka

##This is a test Ruby on Rails app to display the public GitHub event of a given user.

##It is not a complete app, containing the following items needing improvement:
 * Not enough testing
 * Does not request events beyond the default 30
 * Could give much more details on the events, including displaying event payloads in their various forms
 * Clearly written by one who likes Ruby but isn't familiar enough with Rails yet
 * Currently fails when given a non-existant GitHub username
 

###Currently hosted on Heroku at:
